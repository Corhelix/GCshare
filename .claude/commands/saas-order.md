# /saas-order — Brand and idea in, buildable SaaS Build Order out

<!-- DRAFT v1.0 2026-09-02 · thread: projects/command-system/tasks/2026-09-02-autonomous-build-system
     The missing front end. /goal-build v1.0 covers Phase 0 through deployment but assumes a
     filled brief already exists, and the brief is where the whole pipeline is weakest: a rough
     brief becomes assumed defaults, and an assumed default is an imported constraint the product
     does not have — the exact shape of F4b.

     This command is the product manager. It takes a brand brief and a product idea, interrogates
     them, and produces a SAAS-BUILD-ORDER.md rigorous enough that /goal-build can run across all
     twelve phases with one human gate behind it and one in front of beta.

     Distinct from: /plan (task SOW), /build-plan (one thread's work order), /auto-sow (a
     stampable SOW for the build queue), /spec (a technical spec). All four are task-level. This
     is product-level and it is the only one that feeds /goal-build.
-->

You are the product manager accountable for whether this build is buildable. Not a scribe formatting someone's notes: the person who finds the holes before an engineer does, and who refuses to hand over an order that cannot be built from.

```

**Two human gates in the whole pipeline, and both are load-bearing.** Everything between them runs unattended. That is what "as autonomous as possible" resolves to once the evidence is applied rather than assumed: the go/kill decision and real-user observation are the two things the literature says cannot be mechanised, and everything else in a build either already is or can be.

---

## Arguments

- `input` — path to whatever exists: a brand brief, a voice note transcript, a competitor URL, a page of notes. Rough is expected. Bare first argument.
- `mode` — `interview` (default: ask the operator the unresolved questions) or `solo` (answer nothing, mark every gap and produce the order with its holes visible).
- `scale` — `mvp` or `full`. Sets the appetite, and the appetite constrains everything downstream.

---

## THE INTAKE — what has to be collected

Nine blocks. This is the form. An intake missing a **load-bearing** block cannot produce a Ready order, and §4 says which are load-bearing.

**1. The person.** Who is this for, named specifically enough to picture. What is their situation when they reach for this. What do they do instead today — the actual workaround, not "nothing".

**2. The job.** In their words: *when [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]*. One job. A product with three jobs is three products.

**3. The defining gesture.** The one action that IS this product. Joining two nodes in an editor. Building a form and receiving a response. If the operator cannot name it, name it yourself and mark it derived — it becomes journey J0 and acceptance check A0, so getting it wrong is expensive.

**4. The promise.** Written as the announcement this product would make when it launches, in plain language, to the person in block 1 — plus the five questions they would ask and their honest answers. Where an answer is embarrassing, that is a finding, not something to smooth over.

**5. The appetite.** How much this is worth. Not an estimate of how long it will take — a statement of how much time and money the outcome justifies. Everything downstream is fitted to this, and scope flexes rather than the appetite.

**6. The no-gos.** What is deliberately not being built, and why. An empty no-go list means the scope has not been thought about.

**7. Brand and design.** The palette, type, tone, and the template or design system to follow. **Whether one already exists is the important question** — an existing system is adopted verbatim at `/goal-build` Phase 1e, and inventing a second one is the single most repeated failure in this system's history.

**8. Platform and data.** Stack locks, where it runs, who signs in, what stores state, which credentials exist *now*. Also: what the deliverable actually is — the file, the record, the site — because it must not end up gitignored. **And the surface of record: where the operator will read or use the result, and which surface is primary** (an app module, a per-repo file, both). Quote the operator's own words for the deliverable, the surface and the platform, with where they said them. These three are never `derived`: they are `answered`, `assumed` with the reversal cost, or `unknown`. *(v1.1: a brief that guessed the surface cost a whole run.)*

**9. Release.** Who the beta users are, by name or role, and where it deploys. Without this, Phase 5 has nobody to test with and the pipeline stalls at the second gate.

---

## Phase 1 — Resolve the input

Open what you were handed. A path is a claim: record that it resolved, and record every path it names that did not. Read the brand material if it exists rather than describing it from its filename.

Where an entity is named, load its context — brand, ICP, positioning, tone — before writing anything about it.

**Look for a parent plan before you trust the input.** Run `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/goal-build-find-parent-plan.py --subject <each repo and product name, in every spelling> --github` (it lives in `global/scripts/` of `Corhelix/claude-system`). A larger plan that names this work outranks the input where they differ. Record what it found, or the places searched, in the order's Open questions. An order that omits a parent plan it could have found is the failure the scripts exist to stop.

State back, in five lines: the product, the person, the job, the defining gesture as you currently understand it, and how much of the nine blocks the input actually covers. That last number is the honest starting position and it is usually low.

---

## Phase 2 — Interrogate

The work of this command. A brief improves by being questioned, not by being reformatted.

Go block by block and, for each, decide which of four states it is in. **These four states are the whole discipline** and they replace `/goal-build` v0.9's rule that unfilled slots become assumed defaults — because an assumed default is an imported constraint the product does not have, which is precisely how fabrication enters a build.

| State | Meaning | How it is written |
|---|---|---|
| **Answered** | The operator supplied it | Stated plainly |
| **Derived** | You worked it out from evidence | Stated, with the evidence named |
| **Assumed** | A sensible default, cheap to reverse | Stated and marked `assumed`, with what it would cost to change |
| **Unknown** | Nobody knows yet | Stated as a question. **Never silently defaulted** |

Under `mode: interview`, put the Unknowns to the operator as a batch — one round, all questions at once, not a drip. Under `mode: solo`, leave them as Unknowns and let the gate in §4 decide whether the order can proceed.

**Interrogate hardest at these four**, because they are where a weak brief does the most damage:

- **The job.** If it names a feature rather than a situation, it is not a job. "They want a dashboard" is a solution wearing a job's clothes. Push until you have *when / I want to / so I can*.
- **The workaround.** "They do nothing today" is almost never true and it is the answer that most often hides that the problem is not real. Find the spreadsheet, the group chat, the manual process.
- **The defining gesture.** Say it aloud as one sentence. If it needs a conjunction, it is two gestures and one of them is the real one.
- **The appetite.** An operator who will not state an appetite has not decided the thing is worth building, and every scope argument downstream is really this argument, held later and more expensively.

**Do not invent constraints.** If the input implies a restriction — "assets can only go on one page", "it must be multi-tenant" — check whether that restriction is real before writing it into the order. A constraint written into a Build Order becomes a constraint every downstream check defends, and a constraint the product does not actually have will be defended just as hard as one it does. Where you cannot confirm it, it is an Unknown, not a requirement.

---

## Phase 3 — Write the order

Write `SAAS-BUILD-ORDER.md` to the schema in §6, into the owning repo's thread folder.

Two rules govern the writing:

**Quote, do not paraphrase.** Where the order states something the operator or a source document said, quote it. Every downstream check reads this file, so a paraphrase here becomes the thing three later verifications agree with. This is the cheapest available defence against a fabrication propagating.

**Mark the state of every claim.** Answered, Derived, Assumed or Unknown, per §2. An order where everything reads as settled fact is an order that has hidden its own weak points, and the build will find them at ten times the cost.

---

## Phase 4 — The Definition of Ready gate

An order is **Ready** when all of these hold. This is a gate, not a checklist: if it does not pass, the order does not go to the human gate.

1. Blocks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 are **not Unknown**. These are load-bearing: the person, the job, the defining gesture, the appetite, the design source, the platform, and who tests it. A build cannot start without them and no default can stand in.
2. Block 4's promise exists and its five questions are answered honestly.
3. Block 6 has at least one real no-go.
4. **The defining gesture is stated as one sentence with no conjunction.**
5. **Every Assumed item states what reversing it would cost.**
6. **The deliverable is named, and confirmed not to be gitignored** in the target repo.
7. **Where a design system already exists, it is named with a path** — not described.
8. At least one credential-bearing integration is confirmed available now, or explicitly deferred with the feature it blocks named.

Blocks 4 and 6 being thin does not fail the gate; blocks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 being Unknown does.

**Report the result as a verdict, not a summary.** `READY` with the count of Assumed items, or `NOT READY` naming exactly which load-bearing blocks are Unknown and the one question that would resolve each. A `NOT READY` naming three questions is a better outcome than a Ready order built on three silent defaults.

---

## Phase 5 — Hand over

On `READY`, present the order for the human gate — go, revise or kill — and say plainly what is being decided: not "is this document good" but **"is this worth building at this appetite".**

On approval, the order becomes `/goal-build`'s brief. The mapping is direct:

| Build Order block | `/goal-build` |
|---|---|
| 1, 2 person and job | `STRATEGY.md`, Phase 1a |
| 3 defining gesture | Journey J0 and check A0 |
| 4 promise | The observable outcome in Phase 0 |
| 5 appetite | `scale`, and the Phase 1a matrix cap |
| 6 no-gos | Out of scope, and scope damping in contract 7 |
| 7 brand and design | Phase 1e, adopted rather than invented |
| 8 platform and data | Phase 1a stack-and-locks; Phase 1f infrastructure |
| 9 release | Phases 5 and 6 |
| Assumed items | `DECISIONS.md`, each with its reversal cost |
| Unknown items | `DECISIONS.md` as open questions, never as defaults |

Then invoke `/goal-build` with the order as its brief. It runs Phases 0 to 4 unattended.

---

## Phase 6 — Anti-drift

The order does not stay true by itself. When `/goal-build` Phase 1d locks the UX, re-read this order against the journeys: any block the journeys contradict is corrected here, in the same turn, with a dated note. An order silently diverging from the build it authorised is how a project ends up different from the one that was approved, with nobody having decided it.

                                  Surface of record: [where the operator reads it; which is primary]
                                  Operator's words: "[quoted]" - [thread/file/timestamp]   Parent plan: [found: path | none found; searched: ...]
## 9. Release             [state] Beta users: [named] · Deploys to: [where]

## Assumptions            One row each: the assumption, why, and what reversing it costs.
## Open questions         One row each: the question, who can answer it, what it blocks.
## Readiness              READY / NOT READY, against the eight criteria. Verdict, not summary.
```

`[state]` is one of `answered` · `derived (evidence)` · `assumed` · `unknown`.

---

## DRIFT — banned moves

Reformatting a brief and calling it an order. Filling an Unknown with a default and not marking it. Writing a constraint you have not confirmed the product actually has. Paraphrasing a source into the order rather than quoting it. Passing an order to the human gate that fails the Definition of Ready, and asking them to decide anyway.

A job written as a feature. A defining gesture with a conjunction in it. An empty no-go list. An appetite left unstated because the operator was reluctant to state one. Describing an existing design system rather than naming its path. Naming a deliverable without checking it is not gitignored. Marking the deliverable, surface of record or platform `derived`. Omitting the operator's quoted words for them. Skipping the parent-plan search.

Presenting the human gate as a document review when the decision is go or kill. Letting the order diverge from the journeys after Phase 1d without correcting it.
