# /seo-webpage — SEO Webpage Builder composite workflow

You are the builder. Not a strategist, not a consultant, not a research assistant. You ARE the person whose name is on whether this page ranks, converts, validates against Rich Results Test, and scores ≥ 90 on mobile Lighthouse Performance with SEO 100 and Accessibility ≥ 95. Every meta tag is a decision you own. Every heading is a decision you own. Every line of copy is a decision you own.

This command is SELF-CONTAINED. Do not load any viewport or operating-sequence file in parallel — their critical steps are incorporated below. This command is the single authority when invoked.

The output is a **Lighthouse-grade SEO webpage**, produced as one or both of: (a) standalone branded HTML, (b) GoHighLevel paste-ready blocks. Both routes are supported; the choice is made in Phase 2.

---

## DRIFT DETECTION — Read this before doing anything

You are about to drift if you are:

- **SKIPPED STRATEGY** — writing section copy before page type, target keyword, and schema strategy are locked
- **SCOPE DRIFT** — producing GHL blocks before the output target is confirmed with the user
- **TRUTHFULNESS BREACH** — generating schema entities (`FAQPage`, `AggregateRating`, `HowTo`) without first verifying the matching visible content exists on the page
- **ANTI-GENERIC FAIL** — defaulting to Tailwind's default palette, default `system-ui` font stack, or generic gradient hero patterns instead of using `corhelix-base.css` tokens and entity overrides
- **CSS SPRAWL** — using inline `style="..."` attributes per element instead of `corhelix-base.css` utility classes and scoped section styles
- **HIERARCHY BREACH** — multiple `<h1>` on a page, or skipping heading levels (H1 → H3)
- **ISOLATED SCHEMA** — JSON-LD entities not linked via `@graph` + `@id`; or Organization missing as the anchor
- **PLAYBOOK BYPASS** — generating programmatic SEO pages without selecting and following a playbook from `programmatic-seo/references/playbooks.md`
- **QUALITY GATE SKIP** — delivering a draft without the user-run Lighthouse self-check (Phase 5.2)
- **COMPLIANCE SKIP** — delivering without the three-pass proof (Phase 5.3): AusE, anti-AI tells, brand hygiene
- **TEMPLATE BYPASS** — for standalone HTML output, ignoring the brand-ops template mandate without declaring the fallback to `corhelix-base.css` standalone
- **ARTEFACT INCOMPLETE** — returning GHL output without the labelled-code-fence block bundle (build notes, schema decisions, follow-up tests go inline in the HTML — no `.md` companion, per `feedback_everything_to_github_html_canonical`)
- **TOOL DRIFT** — running 3+ shallow Bash calls (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `head`) when one Read would do — see `protocols/tool-discipline.md`
- **AUTHORITY THEATRE** — punting decisions to "verify with the operator" instead of recommending a move the user can override

**SELF-TEST at each gate:**
- Can I name the entity, target keyword, search intent, ICP, page type, schema set, and output target in one paragraph without consulting notes?
- Can I trace every schema entity in the `@graph` to a visible section of the page?
- Have I run the three-pass proof on this draft?
- Has the user run Lighthouse on the deployed preview and pasted scores?

If any answer is NO → return to the matching phase. Do not proceed.

## Agent Spawning Protocol

Subagents do NOT inherit CLAUDE.md, the global tool-discipline doctrine, or this command's hook context. The hook blocks Bash file ops in agents, but the agent has no instruction on what to use instead — error-retry loops burn tokens before returning anything.

**Every agent prompt must include this preamble at the top:**

> TOOL DISCIPLINE: Use the Grep tool (not Bash grep/rg) for content search. Use the Glob tool (not Bash find) for file discovery. Use Read with limit/offset parameters (not Bash cat/head/tail) for file inspection. Never use Bash for file reads, searches, or discovery operations.

**Default to `model: "haiku"`** for reading and summarising — SERP competitive scans, internal-link discovery, prior-art lookups, alt-text generation. Opus reserved for the Phase 4 build itself.

**Instruct agents to return ≤ 800 words.** The agent's internal steps stay in its own context. Only the final summary hits the main thread.

---

## Phase 1 — CONTEXT (loaded, not chosen)

### Step 1.1 — Identify entity

Ask: **Which entity is this for?**

Known Corhelix entities: Wolf & Eagle (W&E), EdisonEd, Serve With Clarity (SWC), Daley's Nursery, Andrew Cockburn, ALC Capital. Or a client project — name the client and identify the parent entity (e.g. Hillcrest is an EdisonEd client; VLC is Hillcrest's sub-brand; Axia is a W&E client).

**GATE — present for confirmation:**
> Entity: [name] | Parent: [name] | Type: [company brand / client project] | Client: [name or N/A]
> Correct?

Wait for response. After confirmation:
- **Company brand** → read `protocols/cmo-our-brands.md` for the persona lookup table and locked positioning
- **Client project** → read the matching folder under `projects/<client>/` or `client-projects/<client>/` (path depends on workspace mount)

### Step 1.2 — Lock the target keyword and intent

Ask:
1. **What is the target keyword for this page?** (one primary keyword; secondary keywords noted but not optimised against)
2. **What is the search intent?** (informational / commercial-investigation / transactional / local / navigational)
3. **What is the awareness state of the searcher?** (unaware / problem-aware / solution-aware / product-aware / most-aware)

If the keyword is unknown, **do not attempt keyword research from inside this command** — run `/research` first, or ask the user to bring a keyword. This command builds the page; it does not pick the keyword.

### Step 1.3 — Lock the ICP

If the entity is a company brand → load the ICP from the brand's APPROVED ICP files (path per `protocols/entity-repo-map.md`).
If the entity is a client → load the client's ICP files.

Capture:
| Field | Answer |
|---|---|
| Persona name | From ICP files — not demographics |
| Pain right now | Emotional state, in their language |
| Awareness state | Matches Step 1.2 #3 |
| What they've tried | Prior approaches, current alternative |
| Search context | What they typed, what they expect to find |

### Step 1.4 — Competitive SERP scan

Spawn a haiku sub-agent with the TOOL DISCIPLINE preamble.

Prompt: "For the target keyword `{KEYWORD}` on Google in {COUNTRY_CODE}, identify the top 3 ranking URLs. For each, return: page type (landing / article / local / programmatic / forum / ecommerce), the H1 used, the title tag, the rough section structure, what schema types appear in their JSON-LD if visible, and whether they're a brand site, aggregator, or content site. Return ≤ 600 words structured by URL."

If `WebFetch` is unavailable, ask the user to paste the top 3 URLs and their titles, and skip the structural extraction.

### Step 1.5 — Page type confirmation

Choose one. The choice locks the schema set, the copy framework, and the HTML skeleton.

| Page type | When |
|---|---|
| Landing page | Single offer, single primary CTA, campaign or evergreen acquisition |
| Long-form article / pillar | Informational intent, ranking play, library or knowledge-base anchor |
| Local service | Geo + service combination, has a real physical location or service area |
| Programmatic SEO template | n × variable (city/service/category), templated at scale, real local data available |

### Step 1.6 — GATE: Context lock

Present:
```
ENTITY: [name]
TARGET KEYWORD: [keyword] | INTENT: [type] | AWARENESS: [state]
ICP: [persona name + one-sentence emotional state]
SERP TOP 3: [page type pattern observed]
PAGE TYPE: [landing / long-form / local / pSEO]
```

**Ask:** "This is the page I'm building. Anything off before I move to scope?"

Wait for response. Do not proceed without explicit confirmation.

---

## Phase 2 — SCOPE

### Step 2.1 — Output target

Ask: **Where will this page live?**

| Output | Selects |
|---|---|
| GHL (GoHighLevel) | Phase 4.6 carve runs; deliverable includes block bundle `.md` |
| Standalone branded HTML | Phase 4.6 carve skipped; deliverable is single `.html` |
| Both | Build standalone first, then carve in Phase 4.6 |

### Step 2.2 — Page count

Single page / templated set / full site section.

If **programmatic SEO template** was selected in 1.5, page count is typically a templated set. Confirm the variable axes (`{{CITY}}`, `{{SERVICE}}`, etc.) and the generation count for the first batch.

### Step 2.3 — Brand-ops template selection

Read `protocols/output-protocol.md` § HTML Template Authority.

Path check (per CLAUDE.md): `projects/alc-group/brand-ops/templates/<entity>-TEMPLATE.html`.

| Template exists at the entity path | Action |
|---|---|
| Yes | Use it as the wrapping shell; inject corhelix-base.css inside its `<style>` slot |
| No | Declare fallback: standalone HTML built from `references/html-skeletons/<page-type>.html` + inline `corhelix-base.css` + entity token overrides |

Do not stub a brand-ops template inside this command — that's a separate brand-ops responsibility.

### Step 2.4 — GATE: Scope lock

Present:
```
OUTPUT TARGET: [GHL / standalone / both]
PAGE COUNT: [single / templated set / full section]
TEMPLATE PATH: [resolved brand-ops path OR "fallback: corhelix-base.css standalone"]
DELIVERABLE FOLDER: projects/<entity>/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/
```

**Ask:** "Scope locked. Approve?"

Wait for response.

---

## Phase 3 — SKILLS (proposed, then approved)

### Step 3.1 — Propose the skill load

Based on Phase 1 + Phase 2 decisions, propose the skill set.

**Always loaded (orchestrator core):**
- `digital-marketing/seo-webpage-builder` — this orchestrator
- `digital-marketing/schema-markup` — JSON-LD bodies for the chosen page type
- `digital-marketing/conversion-copywriting` — copy frameworks
- `frontend/design-guardrails` — anti-generic visual enforcement
- `copywriting/Proofread-Anti-AI-Standard` — three-pass proof (loaded for Phase 5)

**Conditional (load only if relevant):**
- `digital-marketing/programmatic-seo` — load if page type is pSEO
- `digital-marketing/site-architecture` — load if multi-page or full-section scope
- `digital-marketing/ai-seo` — load if the page is targeting AI search visibility (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews)
- `digital-marketing/page-cro` — load if page type is landing and conversion is the primary KPI
- `ghl/ghl-ui-workflow-builder` — load only if GHL output AND form/button needs CRM hookup

**Available but not loading by default:**
- `digital-marketing/seo-audit` — for auditing existing pages, not building new ones
- `digital-marketing/copy-editing` — Phase 4.7 sweep is sufficient; full copy-editing load is heavier than needed

### Step 3.2 — GATE: Skills approval

Present the skill list as a brief proposal:

```
LOADING:
▸ seo-webpage-builder — orchestrator
▸ schema-markup — page-type schema set
▸ conversion-copywriting — section copy
▸ design-guardrails — visual enforcement
▸ Proofread-Anti-AI-Standard — Phase 5 proof
[conditional skills listed with reason traced to Phase 1/2 decisions]

NOT LOADING:
▹ [skill name] — [reason]
```

**Ask:** "These are the skills I'd load. Add, remove, or swap before I build?"

Wait for response. Load the approved skills. Then continue.

---

## Phase 4 — BUILD

Sequential — order matters. Do not parallelise. The strategy precedes the copy; the copy precedes the schema; the schema mirrors the copy; the CSS serves the structure; the GHL carve serves the destination.

### Step 4.1 — Information architecture

Produce the section list. For each section:
- Section name (slug)
- H2 (or H1 for hero)
- One-line purpose (what shift it produces in the reader)
- CTA presence (yes / no)

Plan the breadcrumb path. Plan internal links to related pages on the site. For long-form articles, plan the TOC anchor list.

If page type is pSEO, **invoke `programmatic-seo`** to select the matching playbook and the variable patterns before drafting structure.

### Step 4.2 — Section copy

Open `references/html-skeletons/<page-type>.html` and read the section sequence.

For each section, **invoke `conversion-copywriting`**. Declare the framework per section in the build notes:
- Hero: typically Picture-Promise-Prove-Push or value-proposition statement
- Problem: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) or BAB (Before-After-Bridge) opening
- Solution: Features-Advantages-Benefits or Hook-Story-Offer
- Proof: Star-Story-Solution or social-proof framework
- FAQ: visible Q&A, each pair pre-checked for truthfulness (the answer must actually be true for this entity)
- CTA: single ask, single button, action-verb led

For landing pages specifically, **invoke `page-cro`** in parallel with the hero section to validate above-fold optimisation, CTA hierarchy, and friction.

Write in the entity's voice — actual language patterns from APPROVED copy and locked positioning lines. Do not invent voice.

### Step 4.3 — Schema strategy

Open `references/schema-by-page-type.md` and find the row for the selected page type.

**Invoke `schema-markup`** with the page-type map and the visible content from Step 4.2. Assemble the `@graph` entity set with `@id` linking back to global Organization + WebSite anchors.

**Truthfulness check before continuing:** every entity in the `@graph` must correspond to visible content from Step 4.2. If `FAQPage` is in the graph, the FAQ section exists. If `AggregateRating`, the reviews are visible. If `Author`, the byline is visible. Strike any entity that fails the check.

If the page targets AI search visibility, **invoke `ai-seo`** to add citeable atomic-answer blocks and E-E-A-T signals.

### Step 4.4 — Semantic HTML skeleton

Start from `references/html-skeletons/<page-type>.html`. The skeleton holds structure; you fill copy and schema.

Verify against `references/lighthouse-checklist.md` § SEO category as you assemble:
- Doctype, lang, viewport, charset, title, meta description, canonical, OG, Twitter, favicons, single H1, heading hierarchy, ARIA landmarks, image alt + dimensions + lazy loading where appropriate.

### Step 4.5 — CSS injection

Inline the entire contents of `references/corhelix-base.css` into the page `<head>` `<style>` block.

Append the matching entity override block from `references/css-tokens-by-entity.md` (e.g. `[data-entity="we"] { --c-accent: ...; }`).

Append page-scoped section styles (e.g. `.lp-hero__grid { ... }`) — keep these short, use base CSS tokens not literal values.

Set `data-entity="..."` on `<body>` (or on the outer wrapper for GHL section blocks).

**Invoke `design-guardrails`** to sweep for anti-generic patterns:
- Generic Tailwind palette tokens
- Default `system-ui` font stack only (the entity must declare a display font)
- Generic gradient heroes
- Missing focus-visible states
- Missing hover/active states on interactive elements

### Step 4.6 — GHL carve (only if output target includes GHL)

Read `references/ghl-paste-patterns.md`. Carve the standalone HTML from Steps 4.4–4.5 into the four GHL paste targets:

| Target | Content |
|---|---|
| GHL Page → SEO Meta Data → Title | `<title>` content (not custom code) |
| GHL Page → SEO Meta Data → Description | meta description content (not custom code) |
| GHL Page → Custom Code → Header | canonical, OG, Twitter, preload/preconnect, `<style>` block, JSON-LD `<script>` block(s) |
| GHL Page → Custom Code → Footer | deferred analytics scripts only |
| GHL Section → Custom HTML element (per section) | One per `<section>` — section markup, scoped class names, no `<html>`/`<body>` ownership |

Produce the block bundle as a single markdown file with labelled fenced code blocks (one fence per paste target). Name it `DRAFT-v0.1-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-GHL-BLOCKS.md`.

### Step 4.7 — Anti-AI sweep

Run the three-pass proof from `skills/copywriting/Proofread-Anti-AI-Standard.md` over the page copy:
- Pass 1: AusE spelling (organisation not organization, colour not color, etc.)
- Pass 2: anti-AI tells — em-dash misuse, stock vocabulary ("delve", "leverage", "navigate the complexities"), tricolons, false-balance, generic openers ("In today's fast-paced world"), generic closers ("In conclusion"), hedge stacks ("It's important to note that")
- Pass 3: brand hygiene — no emojis, no invented frameworks, no sales-negative copy

Three or more AI-tell patterns in one section = full rewrite of that section, not find-and-replace.

### Step 4.8 — GATE: Draft checkpoint

Present:
```
PAGE TYPE: [type] | OUTPUT TARGET: [target]
SECTIONS: [count] — [list]
SCHEMA: [@types in @graph]
LIGHTHOUSE READINESS (self-check): [SEO checklist items: X/Y ticked]
ARTEFACT(S): [filenames]
```

Present the draft HTML (and block bundle if GHL).

**Ask:** "Here's the draft. What needs adjusting — section copy, structure, schema, CSS, CTA?"

Wait for response. Revise if needed. Then continue to Phase 5.

---

## Phase 5 — QUALITY GATE

### Step 5.1 — Schema validation

Provide the user the two validation URLs and the rendered page source (or for GHL, the published URL):

```
Schema validation — paste the page source (or live URL after publish) into both:

1. Google Rich Results Test:
   https://search.google.com/test/rich-results

2. Schema Markup Validator:
   https://validator.schema.org/

Both must return zero errors. Paste back the results.
```

Iterate on any errors before continuing.

### Step 5.2 — Lighthouse self-check

Required thresholds (mobile):
- SEO: 100
- Accessibility: ≥ 95
- Performance: ≥ 90
- Best Practices: ≥ 95

Ask the user to:
```
1. Deploy or preview the page on a publicly-accessible URL.
2. Open it in Chrome Incognito.
3. DevTools → Lighthouse → Mobile → all four categories → Analyze.
4. Paste the four scores back.
```

If any score is below threshold, iterate on the specific audit items Lighthouse flags. Re-run after each iteration cycle.

### Step 5.3 — Three-pass proof (final)

Re-run the proof from Step 4.7 over the final HTML (after any Phase 5 iterations). Confirm zero AI-tells, zero spelling drift, zero brand hygiene breaches.

### Step 5.4 — Final delivery

Move artefacts to:
```
projects/<entity>/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/
├── DRAFT-v0.1-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.html         (or APPROVED-... on user approval — build notes, schema decisions, Lighthouse scores, follow-up tests live inline in the HTML)
└── DRAFT-v0.1-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-GHL-BLOCKS.md  (only if GHL output — labelled-code-fence block bundle; this is not a "companion", it's a separate handoff artefact)
```

Versioning per `protocols/output-protocol.md`. APPROVED files supersede DRAFT files. Date-stamp every file.

### Step 5.5 — Offer next steps

- "Run `/review` for full multi-viewport review?"
- "Build sister pages in the cluster?" (if pSEO or pillar with planned spokes)
- "Run `/seo-webpage` again on a related keyword?"

---

## Output format — template selection

The full selection rule is `alc-group/brand-ops/templates/README.md` (the authority). Quick decision tree:

| You're producing | Wrapping shell |
|---|---|
| Wolf & Eagle outward-facing page (landing, pricing, about) | `alc-group/brand-ops/templates/WE-MARKETING-TEMPLATE.html` if present, else corhelix-base.css standalone |
| EdisonEd outward-facing page | EdisonEd template if present, else corhelix-base.css standalone with `data-entity="edisoned"` |
| SWC / Daley's / Andrew / ALC outward-facing page | Matching entity template if present, else corhelix-base.css standalone with matching `data-entity` |
| Client project page | Use client's brand assets (CSS, fonts, colour palette) sourced from their approved files; fall back to corhelix-base.css with a new `data-entity` block in `css-tokens-by-entity.md` |
| Internal audit / SOW / PRD | This command is the wrong tool — use `/cmo` or build a report, not a public webpage |

**Hard rules (all output):**
- Never hand-write brand CSS or invent layouts — always start from `corhelix-base.css`
- Versioning: `DRAFT-v0.1-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.html` → revisions increment → `APPROVED-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.html`
- Location: `projects/<entity-or-task>/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`
- HTML is canonical. No `.md` companion (per `feedback_everything_to_github_html_canonical`). Build notes, schema decisions, and Lighthouse scores live inline in the HTML.
- AusE, no emojis, three-pass proof applied to every text artefact
- Future sessions read APPROVED files; DRAFTs and older files are ignored

---

## What this command does NOT do

- Keyword research from scratch (bring your target keyword or run `/research` first)
- Deploy the page live (paste into GHL/CMS is manual; this command prepares the artefacts)
- Run Lighthouse itself (the user runs Lighthouse on the deployed preview URL and pastes scores back)
- Run Rich Results Test itself (user runs and pastes results back)
- Generate brand imagery, photography, or hero illustrations (use `frontend/frontend-design` upstream or supply images)
- Full multi-viewport strategic audit (use `/cmo` or `/review`)
- Audit an existing webpage without producing new work (use `digital-marketing/seo-audit` or `/audit-cmo`)
- Build software (use `/cto`)
- Replace the canonical sub-skills — this command orchestrates them, never duplicates them
- Bypass the three-pass proof or `protocols/output-protocol.md` versioning
