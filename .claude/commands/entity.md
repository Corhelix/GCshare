# /entity — Load and verify entity context

Load all context files for a brand entity. Verify completeness. Flag gaps.

---

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Identify the entity

Ask: **Which entity is this for?**

Known entities: Wolf & Eagle, EdisonEd, Serve With Clarity, Daleys Nursery, Andrew Cockburn, ALC Capital.

If the user names a client (e.g., "Axia Office", "Hillcrest"), identify the parent entity first (Axia → Wolf & Eagle, Hillcrest → EdisonEd). Load the parent entity context AND the client deliverables folder.

### Step 2 — Load entity files

Read `protocols/entity-repo-map.md`. Find the entity's table. Read **every file listed** — no exceptions, no tiers, no "on-demand."

Path resolution:
- `alc-group/` → GitHub `Corhelix/alc-group`, read from `origin/main`
- `client-projects/` → GitHub `Corhelix/client-projects`, read from `origin/main`

If a file doesn't exist, mark it as **GAP** — do not skip silently.

### Step 3 — Load cross-entity resources (if copy/content task)

If the task involves written output, also read:
- Universal Writing Guardrails: `alc-group/writing-system/writing-guardrails.md` (canonical, applies to all written output, includes AU/UK spelling)

### Step 4 — Confirm what's loaded

Output a context summary:

```
ENTITY LOADED: [name]

ICPs:
- [ICP 1 name]: [one-line — emotional state + buying trigger]
- [ICP 2 name]: [one-line]

Brand voice: [3-4 key characteristics from tone.md]
Positioning: [one-sentence from positioning.md]
Locked lines: [count] lines loaded (or "none defined")
Banned patterns: AI writing guardrails loaded (or "not loaded — no copy task")

Knowledge passes loaded:
✓ [pass name] — [one-line what it contains]
✗ GAP: [pass name] — file missing

Files read: [count]/[expected]
Gaps: [list missing files and what they block]
```

### Step 5 — Flag blockers

If critical files are missing (ICP, positioning, brand), **stop and flag**:
> "Cannot proceed with [task type] — [file] is missing. This blocks [specific capability]."

Do not infer missing ICP language. Do not fabricate positioning.

## Chains to

After `/entity` completes, the user typically runs:
- `/strategise` — for strategic analysis using this entity context
- `/draft` — for copy production using this entity context
- `/audit` — for auditing existing copy against this entity context

The entity context stays in the conversation and is available to subsequent commands.

---

## What this command does NOT do

- Produce any output, copy, or analysis (use `/draft`, `/strategise`, `/audit`)
- Make strategic decisions (use `/strategise`)
- Modify entity files (flag gaps, don't fix them)
---

## Universal Quality Layer

This command produces written output. Before any draft is presented, written to disk, or marked APPROVED, apply the universal writing guardrails: `alc-group/writing-system/writing-guardrails.md`.

Covers AI-tells detection (banned vocab, bloated verbs, dead openings/transitions), negative parallelism (5A-5I), analogy and metaphor control (6), AU/UK spelling (11), and the 13-step sweep (10). Three or more patterns in one section equals full rewrite, not find-and-replace.

See `protocols/output-protocol.md` § Universal Quality Layer for the full enforcement protocol across phases.
