# /prd-build — PRD Stage 3: Architecture, Data & Milestones

> **STEP 0: FILE-HOME GATE (mandatory).** Before any Write: `git fetch origin`, then confirm the target folder is canonical on GitHub with `git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main <path>`. If it is not there, STOP and confirm the location with Andrew; a folder on local disk proves nothing. **Local `HEAD` stays on `main`:** never run `git checkout`, `branch`, `stash`, `commit` or `worktree`. The branch and the commit are created on GitHub, by API or by local plumbing against a temporary `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, so the working tree is never touched. Never reuse a branch whose PR has merged or stalled; if a PR is already open against that folder, resolve it first. Full text in `protocols/file-home-gate.md`.

## OPEN WITH THE GOAL — mandatory, before any analysis

Canonical text: `command-includes/_GOAL-FIRST-CONTRACT.md`. Summarised here so this
command is self-contained; that file is the authority if the two ever disagree.

Every artefact this command produces opens with these three, in this order:

**1. The /goal.** One sentence, an observable end state someone could watch happen.
*"A thought typed on my phone shows up as a tracked contract on the board inside 30
seconds"* — not *"improve the capture pipeline"*. If it cannot be watched happening,
it is not a goal yet.

**2. Sprints to get there (roughly).** Numbered, one line each, each with its own
**success looks like** — again something watchable. Rough is expected; wrong-but-
concrete beats vague-but-safe. If you cannot state success for a sprint, write
`success: unknown` and say why. A fabricated criterion is worse than an admitted gap.

**3. The loop**, stated and meant:

> **build, test, learn, iterate, rebuild, repeat until solid**

Everything after is subordinate to it. Analysis earns its place by choosing the next
build; it never substitutes for one.

**Banned:** hypothesis written as finding (label it unverified); a findings document
where a code change was available; an options menu with no recommendation; restating
the problem as progress; any section that would read identically against a different
codebase; counting artefacts produced as work done.

**Test before output:** *does this move a build forward, or does it describe a build?*
If it describes — delete it and go build. If genuinely blocked on access or a decision
only the operator can make, say what is blocked in one line and build the next
unblocked thing instead of writing about the blocked one.

**Reporting back:** what you built, what you tested it against, what it proved — in
that order. "Verified" means you ran it and watched the result. If you did not watch
it, the word is "untested", and it goes in the output.

---

You are the Product Lead wearing the CTO hat. This is Stage 3 of 3. Stage 1 defined who and why. Stage 2 defined what they see and do. This stage answers: **how is it built, what's the data model, what are the risks, and what does done look like?**

By the end of this stage, a developer has everything: the problem (Stage 1), the UX (Stage 2), and the technical blueprint (this stage). No guessing required.

Requires PRD-1-DISCOVERY.md and PRD-2-UX.md from previous stages.

5 phases: context → task → skills → execute → quality gate.

---

## Canonical output scaffold (MANDATED)

PRDs are dense with decisions — architecture choices, data model decisions, risk acceptances, milestones, acceptance criteria. Every one becomes a row Andrew has to stamp LOCK / REVISE / DROP / DEFER. **Always start the HTML output from `alc-group/brand-ops/protocols/HTML-DECISION-TAGGING-PATTERN.html`** (modules + Decision Register + Archive section + tagging UI). Never hand-write the brand CSS or invent a layout — copy from the canonical and fill placeholders. ID convention: `D` decisions · `R` risks · `M` milestones · `T` tasks · `S` schema/sections · `Q` open questions.

If the canonical is missing, STOP and ask. See `alc-group/brand-ops/templates/README.md` for selection rules.

## Rationalisations

<!-- Source: addyosmani/agent-skills · MIT
     skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md @ f17c6e8 (vendored 2026-05-18)
     Pattern lifted: "Common Rationalizations" two-column table.
     Content adapted to /prd-build phases (architecture / data / milestones). -->

Common excuses for skipping Stage 3 rigour, with rebuttals.

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Architecture is implied by the stack." | 3.2 trade-offs must be named. "We use React" is not a decision; the data-fetch + state + auth patterns within React are. |
| "Data model can be figured out in code." | Migration debt starts here. PRD-3 names the tables, columns, RLS, indexes. |
| "Auth is later, building UI first." | Auth model is foundation. Defer it and every screen has to be retrofitted for permissions. |
| "We can refactor after MVP." | Don't design for hypothetical futures — but don't pretend "for now" either. Lock the boundary that will hold for the next 6 months. |
| "Definition of done is obvious for each milestone." | Obvious is unstated. Unstated is unmeasurable. Every milestone gets a checkbox list. |
| "Stack rationale: we already use Supabase." | "Why for THIS project" is the rationale, not "what we already use". Document the project-specific reason. |
| "API contracts will emerge from the build." | They never emerge — they get assumed. PRD-3 fixes the contract before the build. |

## Red Flags

Stop signs. Do not stamp PRD-3 APPROVED if any of these is true.

- Data model section missing or noted as "TBD"
- Auth decisions deferred to a later doc
- Milestones without a definition-of-done checklist
- Stack choices stated without the "why for THIS project" rationale
- API contracts assumed instead of defined (shapes, error codes, auth)
- Architecture rows (`D`-tagged) with no Context7 verification when they cite library APIs
- Schema rows that don't match the existing repo's actual Supabase tables (when audited via MCP)
- Risks without mitigation in the code (named risks without mitigations are decoration — same rule as /cto)

---

## MCP Tools Available

This stage produces a decision-bearing HTML PRD. Use these MCPs where they apply:

| MCP | Where it plugs in | Use for |
|-----|-------------------|---------|
| **Context7** (`mcp__context7__*`) | Phase 1.2 (Load technical context), Architecture decisions | Pull current library docs (Supabase, React 19, Tailwind v4, Trigger.dev) before locking architecture rows. Stops the PRD shipping hallucinated API references |
| **Supabase** (`mcp__supabase__*`) | Data model decisions, schema rows | Inspect actual columns + RLS on existing repos before authoring schema rows. PRD data model must match reality. Read-only |
| **Playwright** (`mcp__playwright__*`) | Phase 5 (Quality gate) | Render the generated PRD HTML, snapshot, validate the canonical template renders cleanly across viewports before APPROVED stamp |

**Rule:** every architecture decision row (D-tagged) that names a library API must have been verified via Context7 in the same session, or stamped as `REVISE` for verification.

## Phase 1 — CONTEXT

### Step 1.1 — Load Stage 1 + Stage 2

Read PRD-1-DISCOVERY.md and PRD-2-UX.md from the task folder. These are your foundation.

If either doesn't exist: **stop.** "Run `/prd-discovery` and `/prd-ux` first — I need the problem definition and UX spec before defining architecture."

### Step 1.2 — Load technical context

If codebase exists: read project structure, package.json, existing patterns, database schema, API routes, auth setup. Understand what's already built.

If greenfield: note that — all decisions are open.

### Step 1.3 — Context checkpoint

```
BUILDING: [product]
UX SCREENS: [count from Stage 2]
USER FLOWS: [count from Stage 2]
EXISTING STACK: [what exists — or "greenfield"]
CONSTRAINTS: [from Stage 1 — budget, timeline, platform]
```

**GATE — present for confirmation:**
> PRD Build: [product] | Stage 1+2 refs: [file paths]. Correct?

Wait for response.

---

## Phase 2 — TASK

Think through as the CTO:
- What's the simplest architecture that supports every screen and flow from Stage 2?
- What patterns already exist? Follow them unless there's a compelling reason to diverge.
- Where does data live? How does it flow from database to UI and back?
- What's the auth model? Who can see/do what?
- What will break? What happens when it breaks?
- What's the deployment model? How does this get to production?

---

## Phase 3 — SKILLS

Propose skills from:
- `frontend/senior-fullstack.md` — architecture patterns, data layer, code review
- `frontend/senior-frontend.md` — React patterns, state management
- `product/prd-builder.md` — acceptance criteria
- `qa-testing/senior-qa.md` — test strategy
- `knowledge-bank/product-management.md` — product strategy

**Ask:** "These are the skills I'd use. Add, remove, or swap?"

---

## Phase 4 — EXECUTE

Write **PRD-3-BUILD.md** with these sections:

### 1. System Architecture

```
STACK:
- Frontend: [framework, version, why]
- Backend: [framework/serverless, why]
- Database: [type, service, why]
- Auth: [provider, model, why]
- Hosting: [platform, why]
- Key dependencies: [list with rationale]

ARCHITECTURE PATTERN:
[Describe the pattern — monolith, serverless, microservices, etc. WHY this pattern for this product.]

DATA FLOW:
[How a request moves from user click → API → database → response → UI update. Trace the primary flow end-to-end.]
```

Trade-offs: for every choice, name what you're trading away.

### 2. Data Model

For each entity in the system:

```
[Entity Name]
├── id: uuid (PK)
├── [field]: [type] — [what it stores, why]
├── [field]: [type] — [constraints, defaults]
├── created_at: timestamp
├── updated_at: timestamp
└── Relationships:
    ├── belongs_to: [Entity] (FK: [field])
    └── has_many: [Entity]

RLS Policy: [who can read/write, conditions]
```

Include:
- Every table / collection
- Relationships (foreign keys, join tables)
- Row-level security policies (who can access what)
- Indexes (what queries need to be fast)
- Migrations strategy (how schema evolves)

### 3. API Contract

For each endpoint or server action:

```
[METHOD] /api/[route]
  Auth: [required / public]
  Input: { [field]: [type], ... }
  Validation: [what's checked, when]
  Response (success): { [field]: [type], ... }
  Response (error): { error: string, code: string }
  Rate limit: [if applicable]
```

Or if using Server Actions:

```
[actionName](input: [type]): Promise<[type]>
  Auth: [required / public]
  Validation: [what's checked]
  Success: [what's returned]
  Error: [what's thrown]
  Revalidation: [what cache is invalidated]
```

### 4. Auth & Permissions

```
AUTH MODEL:
- Provider: [Clerk / Auth0 / custom]
- Session: [JWT / cookie / token]
- Sign-up flow: [email + password / social / magic link]

ROLES:
- [Role 1]: can [actions]. Cannot [actions].
- [Role 2]: can [actions]. Cannot [actions].

PROTECTED ROUTES:
- /dashboard/* → requires auth
- /admin/* → requires admin role
- /api/* → requires auth (except /api/public/*)
- / → public
```

### 5. Integration Points

For each external service:

```
[Service Name]
- Purpose: [what it does in this system]
- API: [endpoint pattern]
- Auth: [how we authenticate — API key, OAuth, webhook secret]
- Rate limits: [what they are, how we handle them]
- Failure mode: [what happens when it's down — queue, retry, degrade]
- Data flow: [what we send, what we receive]
```

### 6. Risk & Failure Modes

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| [API provider downtime] | Medium | High — [feature] stops working | [Queue + retry with exponential backoff. Show "processing" state.] |
| [Database connection limit] | Low | High — app unresponsive | [Connection pooling. Monitor with alerts at 80%.] |
| [Auth token expiry mid-session] | High | Medium — user sees errors | [Silent refresh. On failure: redirect to login with return URL.] |
| [Large data volumes at scale] | Medium | Medium — slow queries | [Pagination. Index on [fields]. Monitor query time.] |

### 7. Definition of Done

Per feature/milestone, specific and verifiable:

```
FEATURE: [name]
- [ ] [Functional]: User can [specific action] and sees [specific result]
- [ ] [Quality]: Page loads in <[N]ms. No console errors. Responsive at all breakpoints.
- [ ] [Testing]: [What's tested] — unit tests for [logic], integration test for [flow]
- [ ] [Security]: Auth enforced on [routes]. Input validated on [endpoints]. No secrets in client code.
- [ ] [Accessibility]: Keyboard navigable. Screen reader labels on [elements]. Contrast ratios met.
```

### 8. Milestones & Gates

| Milestone | Deliverable | Definition of Done | Gate |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|------|
| M1: [name] | [what ships] | [specific checks from §7] | [what must be true before M2 starts] |
| M2: [name] | [what ships] | [specific checks] | [gate] |
| M3: [name] | [what ships] | [specific checks] | [final acceptance] |

Each gate is a decision point. Do not proceed without verification.

### 9. Dev Environment & Setup

```
SETUP:
1. Clone repo
2. [Install dependencies command]
3. [Environment variables needed — list each with description]
4. [Database setup command]
5. [Run dev server command]
6. [Run tests command]

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
- [VAR_NAME]: [what it is, where to get it]
- [VAR_NAME]: [what it is]
```

## Phase 5 — QUALITY GATE

Read it as the CTO.

**Architecture test:** Is this the simplest architecture that supports every screen from Stage 2? Or is there unnecessary complexity?

**Data model test:** Can every screen in Stage 2 be populated from this data model? Trace 3 screens back to tables — does the data exist?

**API test:** Does every user action from Stage 2's journeys have a corresponding API endpoint or server action? Are error responses defined?

**Risk test:** Are the 3 most likely failure modes identified with specific mitigations — not "we should handle errors" but what actually happens in the code?

**Completeness test:** Could a developer clone the repo, read Stage 1 + 2 + 3, and start building without asking questions? If not — fill the gap.

Fix what fails. Deliver.

**Ask:** "PRD is complete across all 3 stages. Run `/cto` to start building? Or `/plan` for a formal SOW with timeline?"
