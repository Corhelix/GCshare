# /cmo_2 — CMO fresh-eyes launcher (A/B test against /cmo)

> **STEP 0: FILE-HOME GATE (mandatory).** Before any Write: `git fetch origin`, then confirm the target folder is canonical on GitHub with `git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main <path>`. If it is not there, STOP and confirm the location with Andrew; a folder on local disk proves nothing. **Local `HEAD` stays on `main`:** never run `git checkout`, `branch`, `stash`, `commit` or `worktree`. The branch and the commit are created on GitHub, by API or by local plumbing against a temporary `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, so the working tree is never touched. Never reuse a branch whose PR has merged or stalled; if a PR is already open against that folder, resolve it first. Full text in `protocols/file-home-gate.md`.

EXPERIMENTAL. Runs the CMO workflow as a FRESH, ISOLATED Opus subagent (`cmo-spine`) instead of inline in this thread. Built to test the fresh-eyes architecture alongside the normal `/cmo`. Run both on the same brief and compare drift, token cost, and output quality.

You are the LAUNCHER, not the CMO. Do NOT do the CMO reasoning in this thread. The thinking happens in a clean room. Your job is to orchestrate, gate, and deliver.

## The two rules that make this work (read before Step 1)

A 20-run audit of every CMO era (`Corhelix/clarity-os-docs -> docs/clarity-os-tooling/tasks/2026-05-11-printing-press-strategy-research/audit-cmo-flow-2026-06-16/CROSS-REFERENCE.md`) found one failure repeated across the command's whole life: **the spine is substitutable, so it gets substituted.** Launchers swapped in Explore or general-purpose agents, or ran the analysis inline, and only the two runs that actually spawned `cmo-spine` produced a clean accepted output. These two rules are not style — they are the fix:

1. **The spine is `cmo-spine` or it does not run.** You may NOT substitute an Explore agent, a general-purpose agent, or inline reasoning for the spine. If the task is not CMO copy, you refuse (Step 1), you do not adapt the spine to another domain.
2. **No deliverable ships without a validated content-spec.** **Corrected 2026-08-18:** this previously claimed enforcement by `.claude/hooks/cmo-gate.js`. That file is not installed and is registered nowhere, so the claim was false. What IS enforced is `frame-gate-v1.sh`, which for `/cmo_2` requires `.frame-locked` to name a `content_spec_path` whose file validates. That mechanism is real and was hardened on 2026-08-18. Do not hand-fake the spec.

## Step 1 — Resolve inputs (and refuse a non-CMO task)

- `brand` — from the `/cmo_2 <brand>` argument, or ask once.
- `frame_spec_path` — `protocols/frame-specs/<brand-slug>.md` if it exists (check with Glob/Read), else "none".
- `task` — the asset requested. If a task is sitting in the conversation, that is the task; do not expand on it here, just carry it.

**Mismatch refusal (do this first).** If the task is not a marketing/CMO asset — an R&D tax build, a scribe/thought-capture job, a code task, a generic research dump — STOP. Do not arm the gate, do not adapt the spine. Say in one line which command fits (`/cto`, `/rnd`, `/research`, plain chat) and hand off. Run-04 of the audit "adapted the spine to R&D" and burned 34 spawns on the wrong frame; that is the exact move this refusal exists to stop.

## Step 2 — Arm the gate (content-spec required)

Determine the dated task folder first (`<entity>/.../YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`) and commit the task/brief into it (`brief-<date>.md`, or the supplied JD as `job-ad-source.md`). Then arm the gate by writing the **per-session** active marker the hook reads (the filename carries your session id so two concurrent `/cmo` sessions never collide):
```bash
echo '{"workflow":"cmo","slug":"<brand-slug>","task_dir":"<absolute task dir>","gates_confirmed":false,"skills_approved":true}' > ".claude/.cmo-active.$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID.json"
```
(PowerShell: use `$env:CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`. Env vars do not persist between Bash calls — reference it inline every time.) The gate now blocks any `.html`/`.md` deliverable in the task folder until: a brief exists (> 300 bytes), a `content-spec-<date>.json` validating against `protocols/schemas/content-spec-v1.json` exists, and the checkpoint is human-confirmed. The brief, the content-spec and the markers are always writable — only the deliverable is blocked.

## Step 3 — Spawn the fresh-eyes spine (cmo-spine only)

Use the Agent tool to spawn the `cmo-spine` subagent (`agentType: "cmo-spine"`, Opus, read-only, clean context). Pass it ONLY:
> brand: `<brand>`
> frame_spec_path: `<path or none>`
> task: `<the task>`
> Run your doctrine and return the content-spec as structured JSON matching `protocols/schemas/content-spec-v1.json` (frame, analysis with all six 3.1-3.6 points, content_spec, frame_spec_delta, cmo_note).

Do NOT paste prior conversation into the spawn. The whole point is that the spine starts clean — fresh eyes.

**No substitution.** If the spine spawn fails (e.g. "Prompt is too long" in a loaded session, see R3), the fix is a fresh session, NOT a different agent. Spawning Explore or general-purpose in its place is the substitution the audit caught — it does not produce a content-spec and the gate will block your render anyway. Reading brand files yourself in this thread is the inline drift `/cmo_2` exists to prevent.

## Step 4 — Receive, gate, deliver (back in this thread)

The spine returns a content-spec (frame + 3.1-3.6 analysis + content-spec + any frame-spec delta). Then:

1. **Serialise the content-spec to a file** so the gate can validate it (Bash is not gated; only Write/Edit are), into the task folder:
   ```bash
   cat > "<task-dir>/content-spec-<YYYY-MM-DD>.json" <<'EOF'
   { ...the spine's content-spec as JSON, matching content-spec-v1.json... }
   EOF
   ```
   On Windows, heredoc quoting is fragile — write it with the Write tool instead; `content-spec-*.json` is an artefact, never gated.
2. Present the content-spec to the operator for the draft checkpoint, then **WAIT for the operator's typed reply** — do not proceed in the same turn. The gate reads the live transcript and requires a real human reply that lands *after* the content-spec was written; you cannot self-certify past it.
3. On confirm, **lift the checkpoint gate** — re-write the per-session marker with `gates_confirmed:true`:
   ```bash
   echo '{"workflow":"cmo","slug":"<brand-slug>","task_dir":"<absolute task dir>","gates_confirmed":true,"skills_approved":true}' > ".claude/.cmo-active.$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID.json"
   ```
4. **Adversarial verify.** Spawn `cmo-verify` (`agentType: "cmo-verify"`, read-only) on the content-spec + brief + evidence file. On FAIL, fix the `must_fix` items and re-run before rendering.
5. **Render** the deliverable from the content-spec onto the named canonical template, date-stamped `DRAFT-v0.1-YYYY-MM-DD.html`. Never invent CSS — start from the canonical template file. The gate now permits the write because every artefact is present.
6. If the spine returned a frame-spec delta, persist it to `protocols/frame-specs/<slug>.md` via a Bash heredoc.
7. **Disarm** for the next task: `rm -f ".claude/.cmo-active.$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID.json"` (and any task-local `.skills-approved`).

## Why this exists

`/cmo` runs inline and inherits this thread's accumulated context — drift risk and token cost both rise with conversation length. `/cmo_2` runs the judgment in a fresh isolated Opus context fed only the frame and the task. If fresh-eyes wins the A/B, this becomes the default and `/cmo` retires; if not, we keep `/cmo`.

## Requirements + caveats

- `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` must be UNSET (else the env pin forces the spine to haiku regardless of its `model: opus`). Removed 2026-06-02.
- Best tested in a FRESH session. A heavily-loaded session can overflow the spawn ("Prompt is too long"); the restricted toolset on `cmo-spine` mitigates this but a clean session is the right test bed.
- v1 spawns one spine. Tiered haiku readers (brand-reader, lens-reader) feeding the spine are the v2 token optimisation, added once fresh-eyes is validated.
- The independent verify/rate step (audit D7, PRD M3) is not yet wired here. When it lands, it runs between Step 4.2 and 4.3: a separate read-only agent scores the content-spec against the proof standard, the positioning NOT-column, and locked lines, writing the `verify` block of the content-spec before render.

## Agent model defaults (per-spawn)

The spine is the one Opus node — it earns it, it does the hard framing. Set model PER SPAWN via the `model` parameter, never via the global `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` env var (that pin forces every subagent to one model and is exactly why it stays UNSET here).

When the v2 reader agents land (brand-reader, lens-reader, or any read / research / summarise helper), default them to `haiku`, open each prompt with the tool-discipline preamble, and cap the return at ≤800 words so only the compressed read reaches the spine, never raw file dumps:

> TOOL DISCIPLINE: Use the Grep tool (not Bash grep/rg) for content search. Use the Glob tool (not Bash find) for file discovery. Use Read with limit/offset (not Bash cat/head/tail) for file inspection. Never use Bash for file reads, searches, or discovery.
