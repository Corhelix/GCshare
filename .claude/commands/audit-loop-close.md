# /audit-loop-close — Close the Agentive Learning System loop

You are the system architect closing the feedback loop on the Agentive Learning System. The runner produces daily reports under `reports/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Each report names systemic recommendations across five passes (skill usage, skill quality, decision-making, repo quality, strategy gaps). Most recommendations sit unactioned.

This command reads the latest report (or a specified date), extracts every actionable recommendation, presents them as stamp-able decisions delivered via **email**, and ships the LOCKs as PRs on a separate pickup invocation.

This command is SELF-CONTAINED. It is the single authority when invoked.

---

## Two-mode operation

This command runs in one of two modes:

**GENERATE mode** (default) — extracts recommendations, writes HTML, emails the stamp surface to Andrew, ends the session. Andrew stamps in his own time.

**PICKUP mode** — triggered when invoked with pasted stamps or `pickup` keyword. Reads the previously generated HTML, parses stamps, ships PRs per blast radius.

Mode detection (Step 0):
- Invocation contains the word `pickup` or `--stamps` flag → PICKUP mode
- Pasted text in the invocation matches the stamp markdown pattern (lines containing `R\d+\s+\b(LOCK|REVISE|DROP|DEFER)\b`) → PICKUP mode
- Otherwise → GENERATE mode

If PICKUP mode is detected but no prior HTML is found at `projects/system-architecture/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-audit-loop-close/`, STOP and ask: "No prior audit-loop HTML found for [date]. Run generate first, or specify a date."

---

## Canonical output scaffold (MANDATED)

Decision-bearing — every recommendation becomes a row Andrew has to stamp LOCK / REVISE / DROP / DEFER. **Start the HTML from `alc-group/brand-ops/protocols/HTML-DECISION-TAGGING-PATTERN.html`** (modules + Decision Register + Archive section + tagging UI). Never hand-write the brand CSS or invent a layout.

ID convention: `R1`, `R2`, ... for recommendations (`R` for recommendation).

If the canonical template is missing, STOP and ask. See `alc-group/brand-ops/templates/README.md`.

---

## DRIFT DETECTION — Read this before doing anything

You are about to drift if you are:
- Re-running the audit logic instead of READING the existing report → **DUPLICATING THE RUNNER**
- Summarising the report in prose instead of extracting discrete recommendations → **NARRATIVE DRIFT**
- Inventing recommendations not in the report → **FABRICATION**
- Stamping recommendations yourself instead of presenting for Andrew → **AUTHORITY THEATRE**
- Skipping the email step and just opening the HTML locally → **STALE PATTERN** (replaced by email-led loop on 2026-05-20)
- Marking everything LOCK without per-row deliberation → **TICK-BOX BYPASS**
- Treating a "Recommendation" header in the report differently from a numbered finding → **SCOPE INCONSISTENCY**. Both are actionable. Extract both.
- Continuing to wait for stamps in the same session after sending the email → **BLOCKING THEATRE**. GENERATE mode ENDS after the email. PICKUP is a separate invocation.

---

# GENERATE mode

## Phase 1 — LOAD REPORT

### Step 1.1 — Pick the report

Default: the most recent file in `reports/daily/` (lexicographic sort gives the latest date).

If the user specifies a date (e.g. `/audit-loop-close 2026-05-13`), load that file instead.

Use `ls reports/daily/ | sort | tail -1` only when the user did not supply a date.

### Step 1.2 — Confirm + read

**GATE — present:**
> Report: `reports/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` ([size]KB, [N] sessions analyzed per its summary). Proceed?

Wait for response.

Then `Read` the file in full (do not paginate). Confirm:
- Total sessions analysed
- Repo health score
- Total violations
- The five pass sections are present

If any pass section is missing → flag and ask whether to continue partial.

---

## Phase 2 — EXTRACT RECOMMENDATIONS

### Step 2.1 — Scan all five passes

For each pass section, extract every actionable item. Sources include:
- `## Recommendations` blocks (numbered or bulleted)
- `### Top N` lists
- `### Priority Actions` tables
- Any **bold** sentence in a summary that names a fix
- Any item flagged as "Not actioned" or "Needs fix"

Do NOT extract:
- Observational findings without a fix ("Bash dominates at 51%" with no action)
- Statistics for context
- Quoted user prompts

For each extracted recommendation, capture:
- `id`: R1, R2, R3, ...
- `pass`: 1-5 (which pass surfaced it)
- `summary`: one-line impact (≤120 chars)
- `what`: the proposed fix in 2-3 sentences from the report
- `why`: the observation that drove it
- `risk`: blast radius if wrong (low/med/high), and what to mitigate
- `dependency`: any other R# that must land first
- `references`: source path(s) in the report (e.g. "Pass 1 §5 rec 2")

### Step 2.2 — Cross-reference with prior reports

Check the previous report (if exists). If a recommendation appears in BOTH reports and was not stamped LOCK previously → mark it `STALE` (age in days). Stale items get visual emphasis in the output.

### Step 2.3 — Cross-reference with already-shipped PRs

For each recommendation, search recent merged PRs (`gh pr list --state merged --limit 30`) for a closing reference. If a PR title or body addresses the recommendation, mark the row as `CLOSED-BY-PR-#N` so Andrew can stamp DROP rather than re-stamp something already shipped.

---

## Phase 3 — DRAFT DECISION HTML

Copy the canonical template (see §Canonical output scaffold). Populate:

- **Cover banner**: `Agentive Learning System · Recommendation Loop Close · YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Cover h1**: One sentence summarising the report's main systemic finding (pull verbatim from the report's summary or pass 1 lead)
- **Cover lede**: 2-3 sentences naming what the report found and how many recommendations need stamping
- **Decision register**: One row per recommendation. Each row:
  - `id`, `summary` (the ≤120 char hook), `Action` button group (LOCK / REVISE / DROP / DEFER)
  - Expandable detail: What / Why / Risk / Dependency / References / Note input
  - `CLOSED-BY-PR-#N` flag where applicable
- **Deliberately rejected section**: anything the report flagged as a fix the previous /audit-loop-close session DROPPED (for audit trail)
- **Refs section**: link to the source report, the runner's n8n workflow ID, and the Notion database

Output path: `projects/system-architecture/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-audit-loop-close/DRAFT-v0.1-YYYY-MM-DD.html`

DO NOT `open` the file locally — the email step delivers it.

---

## Phase 4 — EMAIL NOTIFICATION (mandatory)

### Step 4.1 — Compose the email

Use the `Skill` tool with `gws-gmail-send` (already authed against `andrew@wolfandeagle.agency`).

**To:** `andrew@wolfandeagle.agency`

**Subject:** `[Audit Loop] YYYY-MM-DD · N recommendations to stamp`

**Body** (Markdown, rendered by Gmail):

```
Agentive Learning System — audit loop close, YYYY-MM-DD

[Report headline — verbatim from cover h1]

N recommendations to stamp across 5 passes.

PASS 1 — Skill Usage: R1, R2, R3, ...
PASS 2 — Skill Quality: R4, R5, ...
PASS 3 — Decision Making: R...
PASS 5 — Strategy Gaps: R...

Quick wins (low blast): R{ids}
Hot path / keystone: R{id} — {one-line why}
Already closed by recent PRs: R{id} → PR #{N}

To stamp, open the HTML:
file://projects/system-architecture/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-audit-loop-close/DRAFT-v0.1-YYYY-MM-DD.html

When stamped, hit Copy in the browser, start a new Claude Code session, and run:
  /audit-loop-close pickup YYYY-MM-DD
…then paste the stamps.

Full report: reports/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

**Attach:** the HTML file itself (so the email is the durable backup).

### Step 4.2 — Send + confirm

Skill returns a message ID. Capture it.

State to the chat:
> Email sent to andrew@wolfandeagle.agency (Gmail message: <id>). HTML at: <path>. End of GENERATE mode. Stamp at your leisure, then run `/audit-loop-close pickup YYYY-MM-DD` in a fresh session.

End the session. Do NOT wait for stamps. Do NOT open the file locally.

---

# PICKUP mode

Triggered by `/audit-loop-close pickup YYYY-MM-DD` or by pasted stamps detected in the invocation.

## Phase 5 — PARSE + SHIP

### Step 5.1 — Read the prior HTML

Locate `projects/system-architecture/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-audit-loop-close/DRAFT-v0.1-YYYY-MM-DD.html`. Read it to recover the recommendation register (id → what/why/risk/dependency/references).

If multiple drafts exist for the date, use the highest version number.

### Step 5.2 — Parse the stamps

Andrew pastes the stamp markdown directly into the chat. Lines look like:
```
R1 LOCK — note: fix this first, gate is theatre until it lands
R2 DROP — closed by PR #261
R3 DEFER — revisit 2026-06-15
...
```

Parse:
- `id` → R\d+
- `action` → LOCK | REVISE | DROP | DEFER
- `note` → everything after the em-dash

Reconcile against the recommendation register. Any recommendation without a stamp → flag as missing, ask Andrew before proceeding.

### Step 5.3 — Plan the work for each LOCK

For each LOCKed recommendation:
- Identify the target file(s) to modify (e.g. `slash-commands/cmo.md`, `~/.claude/hooks/skills-gate-v2.sh`, `skills/digital-marketing/<name>/SKILL.md`)
- Draft the change as a diff or new file
- Branch name: `audit-loop/YYYY-MM-DD-R{N}-{slug}`

### Step 5.4 — Group by blast radius

- **Low blast** (memory file edits, skill description tweaks, doc updates): bundle into one PR
- **Medium blast** (slash command edits, knowledge bank additions): one PR per recommendation
- **High blast** (hook changes, settings.json, ROUTER.md): one PR per recommendation, with explicit test plan

### Step 5.5 — Ship

For each PR group:
1. Create branch
2. Apply changes
3. Commit with format: `audit-loop: close R{N} — {recommendation summary} (report YYYY-MM-DD)`
4. Push
5. Open PR linking back to the source report and the audit-loop HTML

Andrew reviews and merges. He is the sole reviewer.

### Step 5.6 — Update DRAFT → APPROVED

Rename `DRAFT-v0.1-YYYY-MM-DD.html` → `APPROVED-YYYY-MM-DD.html`. The R# → action → PR# index lives inline in the HTML (a table or section near the end). No `.md` companion (per `feedback_everything_to_github_html_canonical`).

REVISE / DROP / DEFER decisions also recorded in the APPROVED file with Andrew's notes.

---

## Phase 6 — REPORT BACK

Post a one-screen summary to the chat:

```
Audit Loop Close — YYYY-MM-DD report
─────────────────────────────────────
Recommendations stamped: N
  LOCK:   N → PRs #X, #Y, #Z
  REVISE: N (with revised pattern)
  DROP:   N (incl. M already-closed by prior PRs)
  DEFER:  N (revisit date)
Stale items (carried from prior reports): N
Health-score delta since prior loop close: +/- N pts
```

Optional: send a second email summarising what shipped, replying to the original thread (subject: `Re: [Audit Loop] YYYY-MM-DD · N PRs opened`). Use `gws-gmail-reply` if the thread ID was captured.

Stop. The loop is closed for this report. Next run loads the next dated report.

---

## Cadence guidance

This command is designed for **weekly** invocation (every Sunday after the weekly Agentive Learning System deep-scan fires). Daily invocation is overkill; quarterly invocation is what the system audit found to be broken.

Pair with the session-start unresolved-items banner so any LOCKed-but-not-merged work stays visible day-to-day.

---

## Core Writing Standard

This command produces written output (HTML stamp surfaces, email body, PR descriptions on shipped LOCKs). Before any artefact is sent or merged, apply the Core Writing Standard: `skills/copywriting/Proofread-Anti-AI-Standard.md` (canonical rule source: `skills/copywriting/Proofread-Anti-AI-Standard.md`).

Pass 1 AusE spelling. Pass 2 anti-AI tells (em-dash misuse, stock vocab, false-balance, tricolons, generic openers/closers). Pass 3 brand hygiene (no emojis, no sales-negative, no invented frameworks). Three or more AI-tell patterns in one section equals full rewrite.

See `protocols/output-protocol.md` § Core Writing Standard for the cross-phase enforcement protocol.

## Change history

- 2026-05-17 — initial spec, single-flow HTML + chat paste-back
- 2026-05-20 — split into GENERATE / PICKUP modes; email delivery via `gws-gmail-send`; added cross-ref with merged PRs in Step 2.3 to avoid re-stamping closed items
