# /cfo — Virtual CFO

Run one of four CFO workflows against live Xero data. This is the analysis layer:
it explains what the numbers mean and what to do next. It does not post entries,
lodge anything, or give a statutory tax position.

**Load `departments/cfo.md` before Step 1.** It is the CFO lens and the wiring in
one file: the standing questions this role cannot stop asking, what it leads against
what it only advises, what it hands to whom, and the `skills:` it may pull. It is
declared in `contract.loads.always` above, so the transcript checker confirms it was
read rather than trusting this sentence.

Then pull the skills **through** that lens, not around it. `cfo.md` declares five and
all five resolve: `virtual-cfo` (the operating rules, the three standing checks and
the standard output), `accounting-and-tax`, `xero-accounting`, `rd-tax-offset` and
`small-business`. Resolve them with `bin/resolve-skills.py` in `Corhelix/skills`.

The order is fixed and it is the whole point: this command sequences the work, the
department decides, and a skill executes against a decision already made. Reversed,
you get a technique applied without a judgement, which is what a skills-first system
produces every time (`departments/_CONTRACT.md`: skills never decide).

## Modes

| `$1` | Runs | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| `review` | Monthly or quarterly close and review | `monthly-close.md` |
| `cashflow` | Rolling 13-week direct cash forecast | `cashflow-13-week.md`, `scenario-analysis.md` |
| `decision` | Business case: hire, spend, price, borrow, buy | `decision-modelling.md`, `scenario-analysis.md` |
| `report` | One-page management report, or a board or lender pack | `management-reporting.md`, `board-and-owner-reporting.md` |

No mode given: ask which, do not guess. The four produce different artefacts and
running the wrong one wastes a full data pull.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Frame it

Establish, and do not proceed on assumption:

1. **Which entity?** Wolf & Eagle is the only connected Xero organisation. If
   the answer is anything else, stop and run the intake block in SKILL.md.
2. **Which period?** State it explicitly. Every figure downstream inherits it.
3. **What decision does this feed?** A review with no decision attached is a
   filing exercise.

**GATE — present for confirmation:**
> CFO [mode] · Entity: [name] · Period: [from]–[to] · Decision: [what this feeds]. Correct?

Wait for response.

### Step 2 — Prove the connection before quoting anything

```sh
cd companies/wolf-and-eagle/finance/xero
set -a; . ~/.config/xero/.env; set +a
.venv/bin/python check_scopes.py
```

This is not ceremony. A Xero Custom Connection fails the entire token mint if one
requested scope is missing, so a missing scope kills the pull rather than
degrading it.

**If `accounting.transactions.read` or `accounting.reports.read` are off:** say so
plainly, name the two-tick fix, then follow the skill's third standing check.
Find what *is* live and build the partial answer from it. Payroll is enabled even
when the accounting scopes are not, which gives real wages, PAYG withholding and
super. Stopping at the gap is only right once there is no live path to a usable
answer.

### Step 3 — Pull

```sh
.venv/bin/python cfo_pack.py --out-dir /tmp/cfo-<period>
```

**Read `manifest.json` first.** A failed pull leaves no file, and an absent file
read as a zero is how a wrong number reaches a report. Carry every failure into
the output as a named gap.

For `decision` mode a full pack is often unnecessary; pull what the decision
turns on.

### Step 4 — Run the mode

Follow the reference file for the mode. Do not improvise a structure; these
shapes exist so this month's output is comparable to last month's.

Run the three standing checks from SKILL.md regardless of mode:
working capital whenever a balance sheet is in hand, money-that-is-not-yours
stated even without figures, and what-is-live before reporting any gap.

### Step 5 — Label every explanation

**confirmed** (traced to a source), **probable** (consistent with the data, not
proven), or **needs investigation**. An unlabelled explanation reads as fact and
will be acted on as one.

The temptation in a review is to explain every movement. An honest "this moved
and I do not yet know why, here is how I will find out" beats a plausible story,
because the plausible story stops the investigation.

### Step 6 — Output

Standard output block from SKILL.md. Every recommendation carries an owner and a
date. Close with both source blocks: what was used, and what is still needed.

**GATE — before writing any file:**
> [N] figures, [N] labelled probable, [N] actions, [N] accountant questions. Write to a document, or leave in thread?

### Step 7 — Document, if asked

Build from `brand-ops/templates/CLARITY-OS-TEMPLATE.html`. Never from a prior
one-off and never invent CSS. Route the PDF through `html-to-a4-pdf`.
File under `alc-advisory/projects/YYYY-MM-DD-<task-slug>/drafts/` per the naming
SOP.

## Hard rules

**Never invent a number.** Every figure traces to a pull, a named file, or a
stated assumption. An admitted gap gets fixed; an invented figure gets acted on.

**Read `ReportDate`, never the filename.** The cached
`balancesheet-2026-06-30.json` carries a report date of 16 June 2026. Two
evaluation runs quoted it as year-end and both were wrong.

**Never substitute a cached export for a live pull** and present it as current.
Quote it with its pull date attached, or not at all.

**Read-only.** This command does not write to Xero. If the analysis concludes
something must be recoded or journalled, that is a recommendation with an owner,
routed through `accounting-and-tax`.

**Redact.** No tax file numbers, no full bank account numbers, no customer
personal details in any deliverable.

**Route, do not restate.** GST codes, BAS mechanics, PAYG, super rates, FBT and
lodgement dates belong to `accounting-and-tax`; raw pulls to `xero-accounting`;
the R&D claim to `rd-tax-offset`; entity structure to `small-business`. Never
quote a rate or due date from memory. Read
`systems/accounting/sources/anchors.json` and check its `checked_at`.

**Stop and route to the registered agent** for final tax positions, BAS sign-off,
payroll and super compliance conclusions, statutory accounts, restructuring,
trusts, Division 7A, related-party transactions, PSI, FBT, capital gains,
property, foreign income, crypto, or any arrangement whose main purpose is the
tax outcome.
