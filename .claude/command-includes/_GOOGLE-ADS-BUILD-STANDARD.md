# _GOOGLE-ADS-BUILD-STANDARD — what a complete Google Ads campaign contains

**Shared include. Loaded by `/google` and `/google-strategise`, and by any command that
proposes, grades or rebuilds a Google Ads campaign.**

This is the physical definition of a finished campaign. It is brand-agnostic — the same
checklist applies to the first build and the fiftieth listener pass, on any account.

> **Why this is a shared include, not a section inside `/google`.** On 2026-08-28 an audit of
> Axia Office found Lane 2 Managed Print spending $237 a week with **zero sitelinks, no
> structured snippet, no business logo and no business name**, and a Demand Gen campaign — a
> visual-first channel — running with **no images, no logo and no callouts at all**. The
> checklist that would have caught it existed, but only inside `/google` Phase 4.
> `/google-strategise` had no concept of assets, so a strategy could be written for that
> account, specifying architecture and budget, without anything flagging that half the ad
> surfaces were blank. A strategy cannot be written against a standard the command does not
> carry. Both commands now load this file.

## The standard

| Check | What fails without it | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| Full asset set on every enabled campaign, at every level it applies | One campaign carries image assets, a business logo, business name and a structured snippet; another, often holding the larger budget, carries none. A missing logo or image is not cosmetic — it is the account leaving surfaces unused that cost nothing to fill | List assets at account, campaign and ad-group level. Confirm image assets (minimum 3), a business logo, business name, at least 4 callouts, one structured snippet header with 3+ values, and a call or lead-form asset wherever the lane converts on a call or a form — on **every enabled campaign**. Presence alone is not enough; count against the minimum |
| Minimum 6 sitelinks, verified destinations | A campaign runs 2 or 4 sitelinks against a plan of 6, or a sitelink points at a page with no real content | Count live sitelinks per campaign. Open every destination and confirm substantive content. An HTTP 200 is not proof of a working page; follow redirects and check hop count |
| Sitelinks match the lane, not just the count | A Canon campaign runs zero Canon sitelinks; a Sharp lane runs zero Sharp. The count target can be met while the account still fails | Every sitelink on a campaign must be relevant to that campaign's own product or service lane. A lane-neutral sitelink (a shared quote form) can sit anywhere; a brand- or product-specific one may only sit on its own lane |
| No duplicate destinations within one sitelink set | Google typically shows four sitelinks at once. Two pointing at the same URL wastes a slot | Diff destination URLs within each campaign's set. Two links to one page is allowed only when the link text and descriptions serve genuinely different intent |
| Both sitelink descriptions populated | A sitelink with one description or none renders smaller and carries less | Every sitelink has description1 and description2 |
| Exact-match coverage for every head term | Without an exact-match variant in its own lane, a head term's phrase match in a neighbouring lane can win instead, so the account bids against itself. Quality Score is also computed on *exact-query* history, so phrase-only keywords may never earn a score at all | For every head term, confirm an exact-match keyword exists in the ad group it belongs to. Pull search terms by lane and confirm each head term's clicks land in the ad group built for it |
| RSA copy carries no near-me phrasing | "Near me" assumes a walk-in visit. For a lease, service or B2B account with no retail premises it misrepresents the offer | Read every live headline and description for "near me", "nearby" or other local-visit phrasing |
| Extensions match current ad copy | A claim removed from ad copy, including a factually wrong one, keeps serving in a callout or sitelink | After any ad-copy change, diff live extension text against current copy rulings. Extensions carry no serving risk, so they get fixed first, not last |
| Callouts add, they don't repeat | Callouts duplicate headline text, or near-duplicate each other, wasting the surface | No callout repeats text already in a headline. No two callouts in a set are near-duplicates. Read the whole set together |
| Structured snippet values match the header | A "Service catalog" header carrying ad headlines rather than services reads as noise and may be disapproved | The values under a header must be instances of that header's category. Services under Services, brands under Brands, models under Models |
| Extensions meet the writing standard | An extension carries an exclamation mark, or a contentless line such as "Contact and save today" | Run extension copy through the same proofing pass as ad copy, not a lighter one |
| Non-www canonical, always | Mixed www and non-www final URLs cause a redirect hop and inconsistent tracking within one account | Check every final URL and sitelink URL. None may use www. None may resolve through more than one redirect hop |
| Final URL matches the lane's intent | A Canon ad sending traffic to a generic quote page, or a lease ad landing on a purchase page, breaks the promise made in the click | Open every lane's final URL and confirm the landing page answers the specific query that ad group targets |
| Every enabled campaign carries the full negative-list set | A campaign created after the shared lists exist inherits none of them | Build a coverage matrix: lists down the side, campaigns across the top. Every campaign gets every list unless there is a written reason it does not |

## Asset location is campaign-type-dependent — check the right table or the check is worthless

> **Why this section exists.** On 2026-08-29, in the same audit this standard was built to
> prevent, a Demand Gen campaign was graded and reported as having **zero images, no logo, no
> business name** — twice, in two separate passes. Both readings came from querying
> `campaign_asset`, which is correct for a **Search** campaign's library assets but is **not
> where Demand Gen or PMax store their creative**. The live ad in fact carried 3 marketing

> descriptions and 2 headlines — all present, none of it visible from the query that was run.
> The gap was not a typo in one query. It was a hole in this standard: nothing in it said which
> table to query for which campaign type, so the same wrong table got used twice and produced
> the same false negative twice.

**A "zero" or "missing" finding is not valid until the query has been matched to the campaign
type it is being run against.** Use this table before asserting an asset is absent:

| Campaign type | Where creative actually lives | Query it |
|---|---|---|
| **Search** | Campaign-level (and account-level) asset library, linked per campaign | `campaign_asset` — `field_type` IN (SITELINK, CALLOUT, STRUCTURED_SNIPPET, AD_IMAGE, BUSINESS_LOGO, BUSINESS_NAME, CALL), `campaign.id` in SELECT, `status = 'ENABLED'` |
| **Demand Gen** | Directly on the ad object, not the asset library | `ad_group_ad.ad.demand_gen_multi_asset_ad.{marketing_images, square_marketing_images, logo_images, business_name, descriptions, headlines, call_to_action_text}` |
| **Performance Max** | Asset groups, one level below the campaign | `asset_group` (id/name/status per campaign) then `asset_group_asset` (field_type/status/asset) scoped to that asset group |
| **Video / Display** | Ad-level per format — check the specific ad type's fields (`ad.video_ad`, `ad.responsive_display_ad`, etc.) before concluding an asset is missing | Read the ad's `type` field first, then query the matching sub-object. Never assume `campaign_asset` covers it |

**`BUSINESS_LOGO` and other `campaign_asset` field types are not universally valid.** Linking
one to a campaign of the wrong type returns an `INCOMPATIBLE_CAMPAIGN_TYPE`-class error, not
silence — treat that error as confirmation the check needs the campaign-type-specific query
above, not as a reason to skip the campaign.

**Before writing "0" or "missing" for any asset row, state which query produced it and confirm
it is the one this table names for that campaign's actual type.** A missing value from the
wrong table is not evidence of absence.

## Measurement traps that produce false findings

- `keyword_view` folds ad-group negatives into its counts. Filter `ad_group_criterion.negative = FALSE`, or counts read roughly three times too high.
- Filter `ad_group.status = 'ENABLED'` as well as campaign and ad status. Dormant ad groups leak in and produce phantom landing pages and phantom assets.
- Negative-conflict checks must be scoped by campaign and ad group. Unscoped, a clean account reads as majority-blocked.
- Counting `<form>` tags misses lead capture inside a cross-origin iframe (a GoHighLevel quiz, for example). Check for iframes and visible inputs before concluding a page has no conversion path.
- Asset counts must be measured **per campaign**, not by summing campaign-level and account-level rows. Mixing the two makes every campaign look identically equipped.
- **A `campaign_asset` result of zero rows is only meaningful for Search campaigns.** For Demand Gen, PMax, Video and Display, zero there means nothing — query the campaign-type-specific location above before reporting an asset as absent.

## Never recreate an ad for a small change without asking first — it resets earned performance data

> **Why this section exists.** On 2026-08-31, working an Axia Ads pass, an existing RSA rated
> **GOOD** (Lane 1) and **EXCELLENT** (Lane 2) ad strength was paused and replaced with a newly

> change a pin is to create a new ad and pause the old one. The new ad started at **PENDING** ad
> strength with zero accumulated asset-performance history. This was done twice, once per lane,

**Rule:** creating a new ad or asset object to make what looks like a minor change (a pin, or any
edit that lands on an immutable field) is never a free or unilateral action. It resets ad
strength to PENDING and discards every asset-level performance signal the paused ad had earned.
Before creating a replacement ad for any reason:

1. State the existing ad's current ad strength and that it will be discarded, by name (GOOD,
   EXCELLENT, etc. are earned signals, not decoration).
2. State exactly which field is immutable and forces recreation rather than an update, so the
   trade is visible, not implied.
3. Get an explicit go before executing. Do not proceed on the logic that a same-copy recreation
   is low-risk — the ad strength reset is the risk, and it is real even when no text changes.

An ad already rated GOOD or EXCELLENT is not touched for a marginal, speculative gain such as
pinning. If the gain is not worth discarding the rating, do not make the change at all.

## How each command uses this file

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `/google` | **Grade** the live account against every row. Findings fold into the ranked report as their own block, not a footnote. Any execution step that would recreate an ad follows the ask-first rule above, no exceptions for same-copy recreations |
| `/google-strategise` | **Specify** against it. Any architecture the strategy proposes states the asset set each campaign will carry. A strategy that names campaigns and budgets but no assets is incomplete. A recommendation that requires recreating an existing ad must name the ad strength being discarded, not just the change being made |
